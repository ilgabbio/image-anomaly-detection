# Anomaly Detection by automated Computer Vision inspection in the Industry

Recent progress in the Machine Learning field, and expecially in deep-learning,
enabled the grow of anomaly detection capabilities by means of automated Computer Vision systems.
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks nowadays are able to discover complex patterns,
allowing not only to distinguish expected content from anomalous one,
but also allowing to reduce the negative effects of changes induced by some external factors.
A fast dive in the neural-networks internal representation of images 
completes this bird-eye view of a new set of tools at the disposal of the industry.
